* given schematic
* identify parts required for schematic
* identify requirements for part 
  * footprint: physical
    * 6.35mm, vertical/horizontal, thru-hole/surface-mount
  * schematic: connectivity - eg: GND, t, r, s signals  
* use octopart and snapeda to find a component
  * try find component with existing 
    * eagle footprints
    * 3d model for CAM

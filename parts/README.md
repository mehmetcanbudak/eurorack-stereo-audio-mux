# workflow
* from schematic
* identify parts required
* identify requirements of each part 
  * footprint: physical
    * 6.35mm, vertical/horizontal, thru-hole/surface-mount
  * schematic: connectivity
    * eg: GND, t, r, s signals  
* use octopart and snapeda to find a component
  * try find component with existing 
    * eagle footprint, schematic representations 
    * 3d model for CAM
  * else, use datasheet to create 
    * eagle footprint, schematic representations 
    * 3d model for CAM

# project parts 
These parts are ideal for this project: 


| Part        |            | package| Got Eagle footprint  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| ---- | -----:|
| Amphenol ACJS-MV-3 | 1/4" TRS Jack connector | custom | No |
